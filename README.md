# tm2pcp-webtool
Interactive webtool that parses Turing Machines from .mt files and constructs the corresponding MPCP and PCP (Post Correspondence Problem) domino sets used in classical computability reductions. Designed for teaching, visualization, and demonstration of Turing Machine simulations via PCP. Includes draggable tiles, step coloring, and MPCP⇒PCP mode.
